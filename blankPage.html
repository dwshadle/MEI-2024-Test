<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'><strong>Preface</strong></p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'>Since early 2018, Florence Beatrice Price (1888&ndash;1953) and her music have experienced a surge in global popularity unlike any ever seen in classical music. At that time, prominent US media revealed the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the accidental discovery of dozens of Price&rsquo;s handwritten scores that scholars had long feared were lost forever. In short, two residents of Kankakee County, Illinois, had stumbled across the items in 2009 at a severely dilapidated house&mdash;Price&rsquo;s former summer home&mdash;and later sold them to the University of Arkansas library system. The library made the materials accessible to the public in 2015. It&rsquo;s the kind of miracle historians usually only dream about. We occasionally find a lost manuscript hiding in a dusty archive, but hundreds? &nbsp;Practically never!</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'>Sensing an opportunity to capitalize on Price&rsquo;s sudden visibility, publisher G. Schirmer acquired the rights to her catalog in late 2018 and began releasing performing editions of her music based on the newly recovered documents. And her music stuck. Tracking by Wise Music Group, Schirmer&rsquo;s parent company, shows well over a thousand registered Price concerts since 2019. Of course, this number captures only a small fraction of the true amount since not all events require registration. In the wake of this performance explosion, as well as outstanding recordings of her music (including several Grammy winners), Price has become an international classical music superstar more quickly than anyone ever could have imagined. Yet no resource available today fully synthesizes her life and music. This book aims to fill that void.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-align:center;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-align:center;'>***</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'>What brings <em>me</em> to write about Price? In the first place, her music. Many pieces in her extensive catalog are truly outstanding. Thrilling, tender, and transcendent, her art songs and solo piano works are some of the finest in the repertoire. I could listen to them all day. (On occasion I have!) Her luminous orchestral works, particularly the solo concertos and tone poems, have challenged me to rethink standard accounts of American music from Price&rsquo;s lifetime. I&rsquo;ve also traveled as far as Vienna to hear them in concert, where they are uniformly greeted with warm enthusiasm. All told, Price&rsquo;s stylistic breadth can attract practically any classical music listener, regardless of experience or taste.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'>Equally important, Price&rsquo;s story intersects with my family&rsquo;s in seemingly cosmic ways that have long compelled me to understand her world better. Price, my father Bill, and I were all born in Little Rock, Arkansas at roughly even intervals: 1888, 1943, and 1981. We knew the same streets. As a small child, Daddy lived around half a mile from Price&rsquo;s address in the 1920s. Between 1997 and 2000, I worked downtown and often drove by the building that once held her husband&rsquo;s legal office. But while an external sense of place is something we shared, our inward experiences of the city were profoundly different. My efforts to grapple with those differences have deeply informed how I&rsquo;ve approached this project.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-align:center;'>***</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'>As in practically all larger southern US cities, the evolving public education system in Little Rock has shaped and reshaped its geography for well over a century by funneling families with school-aged children in various directions according to the serpentine logic of racial segregation. How I came to be a scholar of American classical music history can be tied directly to the segregated world in which Price was raised. I came to this realization most pointedly when I read one of the few surviving autobiographical accounts of Price&rsquo;s youth. In a letter dating from 1946, she explained,</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:.5in;'>By the time I, the youngest child, reached high school, several discriminatory laws were in effect. [&hellip;] When I graduated from high school [in 1903] there was no opportunity open to me&mdash;a colored girl&mdash;for obtaining a formal and inclusive training in a course in music, so my path took me to Boston, Mass., where after three years of study I graduated with honors from the New England Conservatory.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>In fact, Daddy&rsquo;s elementary school opened just as she returned from Boston in 1906; hers was slated for closure at the same time. That his was named after Confederate general Robert E. Lee when hers was called Union certainly captures the prevailing cultural climate. To escape that environment, which only got worse over time, she relocated permanently to Chicago in 1927.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'>Price returned to Little Rock in 1935, perhaps for the last time, to lead a triumphant homecoming recital at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, a building about a mile from Daddy&rsquo;s house. Dunbar had opened in 1929 as the city&rsquo;s principal high school for Black students but was built with only about a fifth of the resources allocated to the new all-white Little Rock High School built two years earlier&mdash;the year Price left. Dunbar became a national leader among all-Black schools despite this flagrant unfairness. When Price returned in 1935, her presence there gleamed like a jewel in a crown of scholastic and artistic achievement. Yet the city school board closed Dunbar and transitioned it to a junior high almost exactly twenty years later, setting into motion a new chapter for the city, and for my family.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-align:center;'>***</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Dunbar&rsquo;s closure in 1955 was a key step in the school board&rsquo;s response to the previous year&rsquo;s desegregation mandates from the US Supreme Court&rsquo;s <em>Brown v. Board of Education&nbsp;</em>ruling. Other parts of the plan involved building two new high schools in segregated neighborhoods and then compelling Black students to enroll at one and white students at the other. This type of quiet gerrymandering created de facto segregation under the guise of family preference. With the new outlying schools in place, the board also decided to give Little Rock High a new name: Little Rock Central. Who could enroll at Central under the new plan remained vague since the surrounding neighborhood was racially mixed. Black families sued to allow their children to enroll, and the courts eventually ruled in their favor. This judgment paved the way for Central&rsquo;s harrowing first year of integration, 1957&ndash;58. (Readers unfamiliar with this infamous historical moment should explore it in more detail elsewhere if they wish.)</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;That year, Daddy walked or rode just along the north side of Central&rsquo;s campus on his way to ninth grade at West End Junior High. He must have seen the National Guard, local police, and US Army paratroopers when they became involved in the fraught integration effort. But I&rsquo;ve always wondered how much he truly grasped. Daddy had permanently lost all use of his legs after contracting polio at age six, a few years before the vaccine drastically reduced cases. From that point on, he was able to walk only with the help of leg braces and crutches. Although he was an honor student and edited the school newspaper in ninth grade, not falling consumed his attention at every standing moment. Challenging as it was, this obstacle nevertheless paled in comparison to burly men armed with military rifles and bayonets telling Black teenagers that they couldn&rsquo;t go to school at all&mdash;or, worse, persistent bomb threats at home.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-align:center;'>***</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'>Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus closed all public high schools the following year, leading to massive family displacement and educational loss throughout the city, particularly among African Americans. Rather than nearby Central, my father attended the Faubus-sanctioned T.J. Raney High, an all-white private school funded by segregationist donations from around the country. Since it was the only tuition-free high school under the governor&rsquo;s makeshift scheme, it also became the main option for students from working-class families like Daddy&rsquo;s, regardless of their political preference. His father worked as a line cook at a local restaurant and his mother on the line at a Westinghouse factory.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Once Central reopened in 1959, still under a cloud of controversy, Daddy completed his junior and senior years there, along with the remaining members of the original Little Rock Nine&mdash;Jefferson Thomas and Carlotta Walls&mdash;and three other Black students&mdash;J. Franklin Henderson, Saundra Johnson, and Sybil Jordan. During those years, he served on the editorial staff of the school newspaper and literary magazine, earned good enough grades to join the honor societies, and even participated in a service-oriented club. Jordan once recalled that the African American students, in contrast, were &ldquo;in total isolation,&rdquo; meaning they were barred from extracurriculars and were given the cold shoulder by teachers and fellow students. Carlotta Walls wrote, &ldquo;I missed feeling like a real part of my school.&rdquo;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'>The artifacts from Daddy&rsquo;s time at Central that I still possess&mdash;his two yearbooks&mdash;certainly bear out this reality. Unlike the white seniors, Walls, Jordan, and the others appear nowhere in candid photographs. Only their extracurricular activities from Dunbar are listed next to their senior portraits. It&rsquo;s as if they were invisible.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-align:center;'>***</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-align:center;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;My mother Anne (Momma) moved to the Little Rock area in 1971 after growing up in several smaller towns around Arkansas. She began work as a teacher in the North Little Rock School District that year and married my father not long thereafter. While the 1960s had been relatively quiet on the school desegregation front compared to the explosive late 1950s, ongoing federal oversight of the issue took a dramatic turn in 1971 with a Supreme Court decision requiring school districts to integrate with more ambitious strategies, including one of the most controversial: busing.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Although Momma was placed at a predominantly white elementary when she first started, she soon volunteered to be the librarian at an elementary in a historically Black neighborhood not far from Shorter College, where Florence Price had once served on the faculty. In this role, she saw firsthand how busing plans designed to facilitate statistical integration undermined stability. For example, groups of white students were bused to schools in majority Black neighborhoods for only one year at a time while Black students from the same neighborhood would be fanned out across several white schools for their entire elementary term. &nbsp;This arrangement created enormous churn among the student body and forced Black families to bear the lion&rsquo;s share of busing while breaking apart their neighborhood social ties.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'>These unpopular and ineffective schemes generated a cycle in which many white families relocated to suburbs that restricted access to African Americans, creating even greater need for court monitoring of school enrollments. The demographics of the Little Rock region had changed so dramatically by 1982, the year after I was born, that the majority Black Little Rock School District sued the two mostly white neighboring districts&mdash;North Little Rock and Pulaski County&mdash;to consolidate into a single district. The idea was that a comprehensive integration plan might get ahead of demographic change. A federal appeals court ruled in 1985 that consolidation would be too aggressive, however, and ordered the redrawing of district lines so that Little Rock would acquire over a dozen schools and thousands of students from Pulaski County&mdash;the district where my family lived.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-align:center;'>***</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Pulaski County Special School District wraps around the cities of Little Rock and North Little Rock like a donut. To the north and west are predominantly white suburbs while most neighborhoods to the south and east are predominantly Black. The donut&rsquo;s diameter is about thirty miles, which created distinct desegregation challenges after the district maps were redrawn. When I was a child in the mid-1980s, the county district had made only small gains toward court-mandated desegregated compliance. To take bigger steps, the board initiated a major overhaul in 1989 with, among other things, the development of a new fourth- and fifth-grade &ldquo;gifted and talented&rdquo; curriculum at College Station Elementary, a majority Black school on the other side of the donut from our house.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'>The new program&rsquo;s explicit goal was to attract white suburban families like ours to attain court-mandated racial proportions without compelling the neighborhood&rsquo;s Black students to be bused elsewhere, as in the past. In fact, College Station parents had boycotted the school for a short time in 1970 to protest a plan that would bus their children to a predominantly white school several miles away. Despite the long bus ride, my parents sent my brother Matthew to College Station as a fifth grader during the program&rsquo;s first year to see if it could work for us. I followed as a fourth grader a year later. Ultimately, the College Station program was so successful at meeting court desegregation orders that it was extended to Fuller Junior High and Mills High School in the nearby neighborhood of Sweet Home. And it was so successful for us that Matthew and I both took part in the program until we graduated in the late 1990s. It changed my life.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-align:center;'>***</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;What does any of this history have to do with music, much less Florence Price? Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Little Rock was home to a modest but thriving youth orchestra program supported by area school districts. The district realignment of the mid-1980s led to significant budget challenges for our school district, which drastically cut support for stringed instrument instruction. Yet the board retained strings education at College Station&mdash;and eventually at Fuller and Mills&mdash;for dual desegregation purposes: to add an extra artistic incentive for white suburban students and to increase African American participation in extracurricular activities beyond athletics.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The plan worked on several levels relevant to this project. As soon as I started the fourth grade at College Station, I signed up to study viola in the beginning strings class. I eventually took private lessons, joined the reconstituted youth orchestra (then co-sponsored by a local university and professional symphony), majored in viola performance as an undergraduate, and chose to make orchestral music central to my professional scholarly identity. At the same time, my school orchestra experience was precisely the type of music education that Price had desired nearly a century earlier but was systematically denied&mdash;one where everyone was welcome and participated enthusiastically. The quality of the program, as well as the accessibility of instrument loans or rentals, attracted every type of student at the school.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'>What&rsquo;s more, my junior high and high school orchestra director, James Hatch, incorporated the history of African American classical musicmaking into our curriculum. We even had listening sessions and written exams that highlighted famous Black musicians from Arkansas, such as composer William Grant Still and soprano Barbara Hendricks. I still remember studying Hendricks&rsquo;s 1981 world premiere recording of David Del Tredici&rsquo;s <em>Final Alice</em> in our rehearsal room. But did Mr. Hatch introduce us to Florence Price?</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'>The North Arkansas Symphony gave the contemporary premiere of Price&rsquo;s <em>Symphony in E Minor</em>&mdash;unheard since 1933&mdash;in April 1986, the very moment when the Pulaski County schools were facing budget problems and desegregation realignment challenges. The same group performed it again ten years later, when I was in ninth grade. With both performances receiving significant coverage in the Little Rock press, it&rsquo;s just the sort of thing that would have come to his attention. My memory is too fuzzy on the details to say with absolute certainty that Price&rsquo;s name came to me then. But when I first perused Rae Linda Brown and Wayne Shirley&rsquo;s 2008 critical edition of her first and third symphonies on the bookshelf in graduate school, her story spoke to me as if I had been a part of it all along.</p>
<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;text-indent:.5in;'>As this brief sketch shows, complex historical entanglements involving race and racism still directly affect ordinary Americans, even in the relatively tiny world of classical music. Rather than let these entanglements divide, this book aims to show how burdens of the past have the potential to reveal what we share across difference. And I hope it honors the individuals and groups whose hundred-year efforts to integrate this country&rsquo;s institutions came at the risk of their own lives. Ultimately, their work and their resolve formed who I am today and created the environment that made this project possible.</p>
