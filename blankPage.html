  <p>PREFACE

Composer Florence Beatrice Price (1888–1953) and her music have experienced an unprecedented surge in popularity around the globe after prominent US media coverage sparked a flood of new interest early in 2018. These reports detailed the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the accidental discovery of dozens of Price’s handwritten scores that scholars had long feared were lost forever. In short, two residents of Kankakee County, Illinois, stumbled across the items in 2009 at a severely dilapidated house and sold them to the University of Arkansas library system the following year. The library made the materials accessible to the public in 2015. It’s the kind of miracle historians usually only dream about.
Sensing an opportunity to capitalize on Price’s sudden visibility, publisher G. Schirmer acquired the rights to her catalog in late 2018 and began releasing performing editions of her music based on the university’s holdings. And her music stuck. Tracking by Wise Music Group, Schirmer’s parent company, shows well over a thousand registered Price concerts since 2019—a number that captures only a fraction of the true amount. In the wake of these multiplying performances and outstanding recordings of her music in every genre, including several Grammy winners, Price has become an international classical music superstar more quickly than anyone ever could have imagined. Yet we have no resource that fully synthesizes her life and music.
This book aims to fill that void.

What brings me to Florence Price? In the first place, her music—a catalog of hundreds of pieces—is outstanding. By turns thrilling, tender, and transcendent, her art songs and pieces for solo piano are some of the finest in the repertoire. I could listen to them all day long. On occasion I have! Equally important for me personally, Price’s story intersects with my family’s in seemingly cosmic ways that have long compelled me to understand her world better. This book bears the mark of those intersections.
Price, my father Bill, and I were all born in Little Rock, Arkansas at roughly even intervals: 1888, 1943, and 1981. We knew the same streets. As a small child, Daddy lived around half a mile from Price’s home in the 1920s. Between 1997 and 2000, I worked downtown and often drove by the building that once held her husband’s legal office. But while an external sense of place is something we shared, our inward experiences of it were profoundly different.
As in practically all larger southern US cities, the evolving public education system in Little Rock has indelibly shaped its geography for well over a century by funneling families with school-aged children in one direction or another according to the serpentine logic of racial segregation. How I came to be a scholar of American classical music history can be tied directly to the segregated world in which Price was raised.
I came to this realization most pointedly when I read one of the few surviving autobiographical accounts of Price’s youth. In a letter dating from 1946, she explained,
By the time I, the youngest child, reached high school, several discriminatory laws were in effect. […] When I graduated from high school [in 1903] there was no opportunity open to me—a colored girl—for obtaining a formal and inclusive training in a course in music, so my path took me to Boston, Mass., where after three years of study I graduated with honors from the New England Conservatory.
In fact, Daddy’s elementary school opened just as she returned from Boston in 1906 while hers was slated for closure. That his was named after Confederate general Robert E. Lee when hers was called Union certainly captures the prevailing sentiment of the day.
Price relocated to Chicago permanently in 1927 but visited Little Rock in 1935 to lead a triumphant homecoming recital at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, a building about a mile from my father’s house. Dunbar had opened in 1929 as the city’s principal high school for Black students but was built with only about a fifth of the resources allocated to the new all-white Little Rock High School built two years earlier—the year Price left. Dunbar became a national leader among all-Black schools despite this flagrant unfairness. When Price returned in 1935, her presence there was like a jewel in a crown of scholastic and artistic achievement. Yet the city school board closed Dunbar and transitioned it to a junior high almost exactly twenty years later, setting into motion a new chapter for the city, and for my family.

***

	Dunbar’s closure in 1955 was a key step in the school board’s response to previous year’s Brown v. Board of Education desegregation mandates. Other parts of the plan involved building two new high schools in segregated neighborhoods and then compelling Black students to enroll at one and white students at the other. This type of gerrymandering created de facto segregation under the guise of family preference. With the new outlying schools in place, the board also decided to give Little Rock High a new name: Little Rock Central. The question of who could enroll at Central remained vague in the plan since the surrounding neighborhood was racially mixed. Black families sued to allow their children to enroll, and the courts eventually ruled in their favor. This judgment paved the way for Central’s harrowing first year of integration, 1957–58, which readers unfamiliar with this history can explore in more detail elsewhere.
	That year, Daddy walked or rode just along the north side of the Central campus on his way to ninth grade at West End Junior High. He must have seen the National Guard, local police, and US Army paratroopers when they became involved in the fraught integration effort. But I’ve always wondered how much he truly grasped. Daddy had permanently lost all use of his legs at age six after contracting polio in 1949, a few years before the vaccine. He was able to move about only with the help of leg braces and crutches. Although he was an honor student and edited the school newspaper in ninth grade, not falling consumed his attention at every standing moment. Challenging as it was, though, this obstacle paled in comparison to burly men armed with military rifles and bayonets telling Black teenagers old enough to be Price’s grandchildren that they couldn’t go to school at all.
Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus closed all public high schools the following year, leading to massive family displacement and educational loss, particularly among African Americans. Rather than nearby Central, my father attended the Faubus-sanctioned T.J. Raney High, an all-white private school funded by segregationist donations from around the country. Since it was the only tuition-free high school under the governor’s makeshift scheme, it also became the main option for students from working-class families like Daddy’s, regardless of their political preference. His father worked as a line cook at a local restaurant and his mother on the line at a Westinghouse factory.
	Once Central reopened in 1959, still under a cloud of controversy, Daddy completed his junior and senior years there, along with the remaining members of the original Little Rock Nine—Jefferson Thomas and Carlotta Walls—and three other Black students—J. Franklin Henderson, Saundra Johnson, and Sybil Jordan. During those years, he served on the editorial staff of the school newspaper and literary magazine, earned good enough grades to join the honor societies, and even participated in a service-oriented club. In contrast, Jordan once recalled that the African American students were “in total isolation,” meaning they were barred from extracurriculars and were given the cold shoulder by teachers and students alike. Carlotta Walls wrote, “I missed feeling like a real part of my school.” The artifacts from Daddy’s time at Central that I still possess—his two yearbooks—certainly bear this out. Unlike the white seniors, Walls, Jordan, and the others appear nowhere in candid photographs, and only their extracurricular activities from Dunbar are listed next to their senior portraits. It’s as if they were invisible.

	My mother Anne (Momma) moved to the Little Rock area in 1971 after growing up in several smaller towns around Arkansas. She began work as a teacher in the North Little Rock School District that year and married my father not long thereafter. While the 1960s had been relatively quiet on the school desegregation front compared to the explosive late 1950s, ongoing federal oversight of the issue took a dramatic turn in 1971 with a Supreme Court decision requiring school districts to integrate with more ambitious strategies, including one of the most controversial: busing.
	Although Momma was placed at a predominantly white elementary school when she first started, she soon volunteered to be the librarian at an elementary in a historically Black neighborhood not far from Shorter College, where Florence Price had once served on the faculty. In this role, she saw firsthand how busing plans designed to facilitate statistical integration undermined stability. For example, groups of white students were bused to schools in majority Black neighborhoods for only one year at a time while Black students from the same neighborhood would be fanned out across several white schools for their entire elementary term.  This arrangement created enormous churn among the student body and forced Black families to bear the lion’s share of busing while breaking apart their neighborhood social ties.
These unpopular and ineffective schemes generated a cycle in which many white families relocated to suburbs that restricted access to African Americans, creating even greater need for court monitoring of school enrollments. The demographics of the Little Rock region had changed so dramatically by 1982, the year after I was born, that the majority Black Little Rock School District sued the two mostly white neighboring districts—North Little Rock and Pulaski County—to consolidate into a single district, hopefully facilitating an integration plan that could get ahead of demographic change. A federal appeals court ruled in 1985 that consolidation would be too aggressive, however, and ordered the redrawing of district lines so that Little Rock would acquire over a dozen schools and thousands of students from Pulaski County—the district where my family lived.

	The Pulaski County Special School District wraps around the cities of Little Rock and North Little Rock like a donut. To the north and west are predominantly white suburbs while most neighborhoods to the south and east are predominantly Black. The donut’s diameter is about thirty miles, which created distinct desegregation challenges after the district maps were redrawn. When I was a child in the mid-1980s, the county district had made only small gains toward court-mandated desegregated compliance. To take bigger steps, the board initiated a major overhaul in 1989 with, among other things, the development of a new fourth- and fifth-grade “gifted and talented” curriculum at College Station Elementary, a majority Black school on the other side of the donut from our house.
The new program’s explicit goal was to attract white suburban families like ours to attain court-mandated racial proportions without compelling the neighborhood’s Black students to be bused elsewhere, as in the past. In fact, College Station parents had boycotted the school for a short time in 1970 to protest a plan that would bus their children to a predominantly white school several miles away, thus compelling them to bear the brunt of the load. Despite the long bus ride, my parents sent my brother Matthew there as a fifth grader during the program’s first year to see if it could work for us. I followed as a fourth grader a year later. Ultimately, the College Station program was so successful at meeting court desegregation orders that it was extended to Fuller Junior High and Mills High School in the nearby neighborhood of Sweet Home. And it was so successful for us that Matthew and I both took part in the program until we graduated in the late 1990s. It changed my life.

	What does any of this history have to do with music, much less Florence Price? Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Little Rock was home to a modest but thriving youth orchestra program supported by area school districts. The district realignment of the mid-1980s led to significant budget challenges for our school district, which drastically cut support for stringed instrument instruction. Yet the board retained strings education at College Station—and eventually Fuller and Mills—for dual desegregation purposes: to add an extra artistic incentive for white suburban students and to increase African American participation in extracurricular activities beyond athletics. Evidently these goals were worth funding.
	The plan worked on several levels relevant to this project. As soon as I started the fourth grade at College Station, I signed up to study viola in the beginning strings class. I eventually took private lessons, joined the reconstituted youth orchestra (then co-sponsored by a local university and professional symphony), majored in viola performance as an undergraduate, and chose to make orchestral music central to my professional scholarly identity. At the same time, my school orchestra experience was precisely the type of music education that Price had desired nearly a century earlier but was systematically denied—one where everyone was welcome and participated enthusiastically. The quality of the program, as well as the accessibility of instrument loans or rentals, attracted every type of student at the school.
What’s more, my junior high and high school orchestra director, James Hatch, incorporated the history of African American classical musicmaking into our curriculum. We even had listening sessions and written exams that highlighted famous Black musicians from Arkansas, such as composer William Grant Still and soprano Barbara Hendricks. I still remember studying Hendricks’s 1981 world premiere recording of David Del Tredici’s Final Alice in our rehearsal room. But did Mr. Hatch introduce us to Florence Price?
The North Arkansas Symphony gave the contemporary premiere of Price’s Symphony in E Minor—unheard since 1933—in April 1986, the very moment when the Pulaski County schools were facing budget problems and desegregation realignment challenges. The same group performed it again ten years later, when I was in ninth grade. With both performances receiving significant coverage in the Little Rock press, it’s just the sort of thing that would have come to his attention. My memory is too fuzzy on the details to say with absolute certainty that Price’s name came to me then. But when I first perused Rae Linda Brown and Wayne Shirley’s 2008 critical edition of her first and third symphonies on the bookshelf in graduate school, her story spoke to me as if I had been a part of it all along.

As I note in the introduction, Price’s story is distinctively American. In telling it here, I hope to show that American life has been shaped by complex entanglements involving race that still directly affect us, even in the relatively tiny world of classical music. And I hope to honor the fighters for justice whose hundred-year efforts to integrate this country’s institutions came at the risk of their own lives. Ultimately, their work and their resolve formed who I am today.
